# ADVANCED: Express Routers
## Description
It has come to our attention that this project is going to deal with a fair few endpoints. It's been decided that we should make use of routers to help break down the logic into sub routers.

NC notes covers how they can be used to make our applications more maintainable.

They are also covered in-depth in the Express docs.
