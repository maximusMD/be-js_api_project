# ADVANCED: GET /api/articles (pagination)
## Description
To make sure that an API can handle large amounts of data, it is often necessary to use pagination. Head over to Google, and you will notice that the search results are broken down into pages. It would not be feasible to serve up all the results of a search in one go. The same is true of websites / apps like Facebook or Twitter (except they hide this by making requests for the next page in the background, when we scroll to the bottom of the browser). We can implement this functionality on our /api/articles endpoint.

Accepts the following queries:

limit, which limits the number of responses (defaults to 10).
p, stands for page and specifies the page at which to start (calculated using limit).
Responds with:

the articles paginated according to the above inputs.
total_count property, displaying the total number of articles (this should display the total number of articles with any filters applied, discounting the limit).
Consider what errors could occur with this endpoint, and make sure to test for them.

Your previous test cases should not need amending.

Remember to add a description of this endpoint to your /api endpoint.
